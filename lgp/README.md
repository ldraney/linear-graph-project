# Linear Plot Application

This directory houses the Dash application designed to illustrate the linear relationship between household outreach and life insurance policy sales, represented by the equation \(Y = M \times X + B\). It's an interactive tool aimed at providing agents with a clear visual understanding of how their efforts (X) and conversion efficiency (M) impact policy sales (Y).

## Structure of the Application

- **app.py**: The main entry point for the Dash application. Initializes the app and brings together all components.
- **layouts.py**: Defines the layout of the app, including the placement of sliders, graphs, and any explanatory text.
- **callbacks.py**: Contains the callback functions that make the app interactive, updating the plot based on slider inputs.
- **models.py**: Includes the linear model function and any additional data processing or modeling functions.
- **assets/**: A directory for static files like custom CSS.

## Setup and Running the Application

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you're in the `linear-pyenv` environment as described in the main project's README.
2. **Dependency Installation**: Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (you'll need to create this file with the necessary packages: `dash`, `numpy`, `plotly`).
3. **Running the App**: Execute `python app.py` from within this directory to start the Dash server and access the app in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`.

## Using the Application

- **Interacting with Sliders**: Adjust the sliders for M (Slope) and B (Y-Intercept) to see how changes affect the total life policies sold.
- **Understanding the Graph**: The graph dynamically updates based on your inputs, visually representing the linear relationship between your efforts and results.
- **Reset and Explore**: Use the reset button (if implemented) to return sliders to their default values and explore different scenarios.

## Development Notes

- **Modularity**: The app is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to update or expand individual components.
- **Future Expansion**: Consider adding features like range sliders for X and Y, or more complex models for a detailed analysis.
