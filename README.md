## Getting Started with the Project
This guide assumes that you already have [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) installed on your system.

### pyenv commands
pyenv install 3.12.1
pyenv virtualenv 3.12.1 dad-project
pyenv local dad-project

This project includes a `.python-version` file, which Pyenv uses to automatically activate the correct environment when you enter the project directory:
with a simple cd into this directory you should now be in the `dad-project` environment.
