# linear-graph-project
making a y=mx+b software for a life insurance company presentation

## Getting Started with the Project
This guide assumes that you already have [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) installed on your system.

### pyenv commands
pyenv install 3.12.1
pyenv virtualenv 3.12.1 linear-pyenv
pyenv local linear-pyenv

This project includes a `.python-version` file, which Pyenv uses to automatically activate the correct environment when you enter the project directory:
with a simple cd into this directory you should now be in the `linear-pyenv` environment.
